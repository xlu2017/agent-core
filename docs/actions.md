# Action Catalog and Plan Validation

## Overview

agent-core owns the **canonical action catalog** — the single source of truth for all actions that any agent or executor can use. The catalog defines schemas, risk levels, side effects, and planner guidance for each action.

**Architecture boundary (decision 0006):**
- `agent-core` — action catalog, Zod schemas, advisory planning, deterministic validation, plan repair, outcome records
- `jubilant-goggles` — runtime authorization, worktree/path validation, execution, service control, browser/desktop control, commits/PRs, approvals/secrets

agent-core does **not** execute actions. It validates plans deterministically and provides advisory planning.

## Canonical Action Catalog

The catalog is defined in `src/actions/catalog/canonicalActions.ts`. Every action specifies:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Unique action identifier |
| `category` | One of: context, repo, files, validation, browser_desktop, services, git_pr, control |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `zodSchema` | Zod schema for params validation |
| `params_json_schema` | Auto-generated JSON Schema for LLM/API consumption |
| `output_json_schema` | Expected output shape (informational) |
| `risk` | low, medium, high, or critical |
| `side_effects` | Array of side effect categories (filesystem, process, git, browser, service, etc.) |
| `requires_platform_validation` | Always `true` — every step must be validated by the platform |
| `requires_approval` | Whether the action requires explicit approval before execution |
| `planner_guidance` | Advisory text for the LLM planner |

## Atomic vs. Composite Actions

All actions in the catalog are **atomic** — they represent a single operation. Composite workflows are expressed as plans (sequences of atomic actions).

## Advisory-Only Actions

All agent-core actions are advisory. agent-core does not execute anything; it produces plans that jubilant-goggles validates and executes.

## Schema Validation vs. Runtime Authorization

| Concern | Owner | When |
|---|---|---|
| Params match Zod schema | agent-core | Plan validation (deterministic) |
| Action is in `allowed_actions` | agent-core | Plan validation |
| No secret-looking values in params | agent-core | Plan validation |
| `requires_platform_validation: true` | agent-core | Plan validation |
| File path is safe and within worktree | jubilant-goggles | Runtime |
| User has permission to execute action | jubilant-goggles | Runtime |
| Service exists and is manageable | jubilant-goggles | Runtime |
| Approval has been granted | jubilant-goggles | Runtime |

## Secret-Ref Rules

1. **Never** pass raw tokens, API keys, or passwords in action params.
2. Use `secret_ref` fields (e.g., `browser_type.secret_ref`, `update_latest_from_github.token_ref`) to reference secrets by name.
3. The platform resolves secret refs at runtime from secure storage.
4. The deterministic validator recursively scans all params for secret-looking patterns and rejects them with `SECRET_IN_PARAMS` errors.

Recognized secret patterns include:
- GitHub PATs (`ghp_`, `github_pat_`, `gho_`, `ghu_`, `ghs_`, `ghr_`)
- OpenAI-style keys (`sk-`)
- Slack tokens (`xoxb-`, `xoxp-`)
- AWS access keys (`AKIA`)
- Bearer tokens (`Bearer ...`)
- JWTs (`eyJ...`)

## Plan Validation

The deterministic validator (`actionPlanValidator.ts`) checks:

1. Plan mode is `finite`, `loop`, or `open_ended`
2. Loop/open_ended plans should include `loop_condition`
3. Every action exists in the canonical catalog
4. Every action is in the session's `allowed_actions`
5. Every action's params match its Zod schema
6. Every step has `requires_platform_validation: true`
7. No secret-looking values appear recursively in params
8. `apply_patch` has `patch` or `path + intent`
9. `read_file` has non-empty `path`
10. `grep` has non-empty `pattern`
11. `commit` only appears if in `allowed_actions`
12. `merge_pr` only appears if in `allowed_actions`
13. `stop_service` triggers an approval warning
14. `run_tests` before edits is a **warning**, not an error (to allow baseline test runs)

Errors are returned as structured objects with `code`, `path`, `message`, `action_name`, and `step_index`.
